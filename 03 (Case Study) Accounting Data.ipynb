Imagine the case of an accountant who needs to grab a bunch of data and then pull out the required information to answer a question. The steps they might normally take could be:\n","* export the data from the accounting platform(s)\n","* clean and format it in Excel, using multiple worksheets for different tables\n","* create pivot tables, vlookups, manual manipulations and formulas to get the data to answer the questions\n","\n","If you have a one-time task, this might be the best method! It might be quicker and easier just to use Excel.
